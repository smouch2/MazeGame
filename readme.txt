How to Play:

You're an adventurer stuck in a dungeon full of trolls.  Collect the key, sneak past the trolls, and make it to 
the exit!  You start with five health points.  If your health is low, collect a health potion for 3 more 
health points. You can't have more than 7 health points.  You don't have any weapons, so you'll have to survive!
